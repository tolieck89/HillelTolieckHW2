                <p>Briefly following Jonny Craig's departure, Dance Gavin Dance held auditions to recruit a replacement clean vocalist. 
                Nic Newsham of American post-hardcore band Gatsby's American Dream was offered to join, 
                however chose not to despite later featuring on the song &laquo;Uneasy Hearts Weigh The Most&raquo; on their self-titled 2008 album.
                Other singers that auditioned included Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens, Matt Geise of Lower Definition, and Thomas Dutton. Kurt Travis, 
                formerly of the Sacramento based rock bands Five Minute Ride, O! The Joy, and No Not Constant, became the group's new clean vocalist.
                On April 20, 2008, the group entered the studio to record their self-titled second studio album with Kris Crummett.The album was released on August 19, 2008.
                Prior to the release of the album, but following its recording sessions, two original members, unclean vocalist Jon Mess and bassist Eric Lodge, departed from the band.
                Following their respective departures, Will Swan pursued screaming vocal duties along with performing lead guitar, and Jason Ellis, formerly of Five Minute Ride, 
                replaced Lodge on bass guitar. The group filmed a music video for the song "Me and Zoloft Get Along Just Fine", with director Robby Starbuck, which was released November 18, 2008.</p>
                

                <h2 id="2009">Dance Gavin Dance in 2009</h2>

                <p>In February 2009, the band went into the studio as a five-piece to record the follow-up to their self-titled album, yet again with producer Kris Crummett. 
                <i>The resulting album</i>, Happiness, was released on June 9, 2009, less than one year after the release of their second studio album. 
                Bassist Jason Ellis appears on Happiness, however left the group before its release, subsequently being replaced by Tim Feerick as a touring member. 
                AllMusic gave a mixed review of the album, writing, &laquo;Happiness bristles with the kind of overachiever eclecticism that's as impressive as it is divisive,&raquo; 
                but that two songs were marred by the &laquo;nasally realm of high school emo,&raquo; leaving the listener unsatisfied with the experience. A music video for the track 
                &laquo;Tree Village&raquo; was released shortly after the album. The band embarked on tours with American rock bands Emarosa, Closure in Moscow, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, 
                and others in support of the album.</p>

                <p>On February 10, 2010, guitarist Zachary Garren was allegedly ousted by the band due to personal conflicts with other members. 
                Shortly after, Garren met drummer Ben Rosett and formed the math rock trio Strawberry Girls, now signed to Tragic Hero Records.
                Dance Gavin Dance played the Soundwave festival as scheduled as a four-piece with Swan handling all guitar duties and Kurt Travis playing keyboards.</p>

                In August Alternative Press said singer Kurt Travis and Dance Gavin Dance had officially parted ways in order for Jonny Craig to rejoin the band. 
                Before dismissing Travis, the band briefly considered recording an album with Travis and Mess on vocals with producer Matt Bayles at the helm.
